    "# Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "`counting` as in counting cards, is the most basic kind of probability.  The kind of questions that counting answers are like this:  You have a set S, and you pick elements from that set for your new set T. How many different T's could you make?  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 questions you should ask that determine how you solve this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Does `order` matter? Is T = {x, y} the same as T = {y, x}?  If the answer is yes, then order does not matter.  If the answer is no, then order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there `replacement`?  Lets say S = {x, y, z} and you want to choose 2 elements for T.  If you choose x, does S = {y, z} now, or is it still S = {x, y, z}?  If x is gone from S, then there is no replacement.  If x is still in S, then there is replacement.  If there is replacement, then you could have T = {x, x}.  If there is no replacement, then it would be impossible for you to get T = {x, x}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j}, which is 10 items, and we want to find different subsets of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "`n` is the number of items we can choose from\n",
    "\n",
    "`k` is the number of choices we get to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "`With replacememnt, order matters`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  You roll a die 5 times.  How many sequences of rolls could you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  6\\*6\\*6\\*6\\*6 = 6^5\n",
    "\n",
    "On each roll, there are 6 possible outcomes.  1 followed by 2 is different from 2 followed by 1, since order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "General formula:  n^k\n",
    "\n",
    "`Without replacement, order matters`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  How many ways could 20 cards be stacked up from a deck of 100 unique cards?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  100\\*99\\*98\\*...\\*81 = 100! / 80!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each card is unique, there is no replacement.  A stack is ordered, so order matters.  We have 100 choices for our first card, 99 choices for our second card, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "General formula:  n! / (n-k)!\n",
    "\n",
    "`Without replacement, order doesn't matter`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  How many 20 card hands could you make from a deck of 100 unique cards?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  100! / 80! / 20!\n",
    "\n",
    "First we do the calculation as if order did matter.  Now consider how many different stacks of cards you could make with a single hand of 20 cards.  The answer to that is 20!.  So for every 20! stacks of cards, there is 1 hand of cards.  So you take 100! / 80! and divide it the whole thing by 20! to convert from ordered stacks of cards to unordered hands of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "General formula:  n! / ((n-k)!k!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is so common it has a name:  choose, or `n choose k`, and it often abbreviated as $n \\choose k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`With replacement, order doesn't matter` Warning, this one is weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  How many ways can you put 5 identical balls into 10 labeled bins?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:  $14 \\choose 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we are choosing bins, not balls.  If that's weird, maybe think of the bin as being 'reused' instead of 'replaced'.  We can represent this problem with a binary string.  0's are balls, and 1's are dividers between bins.  So if there are 2 bins, there's 1 divider.  Since there are 10 bins, there are 9 dividers.  Here's an example ordering:  01101011100111.  There's 1 ball in the first bin, third bin, fourth bin, 2 balls in the seventh bin, and 0 balls in all the other bins.  So there are 10 - 1 + 5 digits, and we are choosing 5 of them to be 0's and the rest to be 1's.  So we end up with $14 \\choose 5$.  We could also equivalently say that we are choosing 9 of them to be 1's and the rest to be 0's.\n",

    "Compare this with what is said by the 'law of large numbers'.  I think it was something like 'if we know the distribution, then we can predict with X accuracy'.  The thing is that you dont actually know the distribution.  Like, pretty much ever.  Because you're a human, and you're bad at collecting data.\n",
