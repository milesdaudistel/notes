    "Vertices with edges connecting them.\n",
    "Why are they so pervasive?\n",
    "Because a node represents a thing, and an edge represents some relationship between 2 things.\n",
    "The easiest example is a map.\n",
    "But there's other stuff too.\n",
    "Like the student exams example.\n",
    "Do the vertices represent students?  Tests?  timeslots?\n",
    "How do you choose what the vertices and edges represent?\n",
    "Sometimes edges are the ability to do things.\n",
    "Sometimes its the opposite.  Edges are constraints."
