    "The project is to develop modular multi-energy system simulation platform in collaboration The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). In this work, a new framework to model and study the effects of renewable energy at multiple time scales and in different sectors will be developed. The current practices in renewable energy integration studies don't allow analysists to perform integrated assessments and require ad-hoc mixtures of software packages developed by different vendors, making the evaluation costly and in many cases incomplete. Moreover, current tools do not reliably integrate electric power systems modeling with other sectors that in the recent years have acquired great relevance to advance the integration of renewable energy, such as natural gas and water networks.\n",

    "The final objective is the development of a platform to model and analyze the interaction of renewable energy sources other sectors considering multiple timescales. The platform will be developed as an OpenSource tool available to operators and analysts to reduce the costs and technical challenges of performing a thorough assessment of renewable energy integration.\n",

We could cut it near the beginning for a cut of 10 flow units, since the other cut is 7 units, we know we won't be able to use all 10 units of this flow.
