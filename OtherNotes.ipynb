    "`What is max flow / minimum cut?`\n",
    "Say you are an oil company and want to ship as much of your oil as possible.\n",
    "There's no cost to shipping oil, so the idea is just to ship as much at once as you possibly can.\n",
    "You live in a directed graph, with a source and a sink.\n",
    "Each connection has a maximum amount that you can push through it.\n",
    "You want to push as much oil as you can from the source to the sink.\n",
    "You can think of it as 'oil pushed per unit time' or something to that effect.\n",

    "`I don't get the graph thing.  If we choose e, why would we choose f?  How exactly are we choosing paths?`\n",
    "You can go reverse to an edge if there is currently flow along that edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "`But f seems to have 1 flow going the opposite direction, so it canceled e and did an additional flow, so it has net 2 flow.  But that's not possible.  What's going on?`\n",
    "No, it's 1 unit of flow.  Think of e and f as being superimposed onto each other.  Then the middle 2 cancel out, and you get the diamond shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "`How do you know when you're done with max flow?`\n",
    "When you can't make any more paths.\n",
    "A path exists if some pipes still need flow, or if you can do reverse flow on sime pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`What stops the flow graphs from cancelling each other out, leading to an infinite loop?`\n",
    "Because the flow graphs aren't actually cancelling out.  When we create e, then create f, e's thing doesn't get 'canceled out'.  They're just superimposed on top of each other.  So we know every way we've gone before.  No information is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Where does min cut come in?`\n",
    "Cutting the graph means drawing a line through the graph so that the source is on one side and the sink is on the other.  Insert the example from 7.2.4 here.  In this example, we have found the minimum cut, since 7 units of flow pass over the cut.  We could cut it near the beginning for a cut of 10 flow units, since the other cut is 7 units, we know we won't be able to use all 10 units of this flow.  Think of min cut as kind of like a pinch in a garden hose.  A garden hose can only output as much water as its smallest section.  Well, not really, but you know what I mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min cut is the dual of max flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "`What is the actual algorithm?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Do breadth first search until you get to the sink.  Create a residual graph thing.  Then in your original graph (or in a third, maybe?) you subtract all the flow that you used from the original graph.  Do this until failure.  Then you'll have a min cut.  The runtime is $O(V*E^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you start a residual graph, which at the beginning tells you the max capacities.\n",
    "Then you find a path through the graph.\n",
    "Then you change your graph based on the path.\n",
    "Do this until the graph is biparted and you can't do breadth first search anymore."

    "Minimum cost flow uses the network simplex algorithm\n",
    "Network simplex algorithm is a special varient of the simplex algorithm\n",
    "Simplex algorithm is used to solve linear programs.\n",
    "So maybe max flow -> linear programming -> simplex -> network simplex -> minimum cost flow\n",
    "\n",
    "`What is linear programming?`\n",
    "You have a bunch of linear equations that are lines/planes/hyperplanes that all cut space in half.\n",
    "Each equation says 'on one side of me is potential solutions, on the other side are not'\n",
    "You need to find the solutions that all of the linear equations agree are correct.\n",
    "Then out of those solutions, you have an objective (max or min) function that tells you the 'best' one.\n",
    "\n",
    "`What is the simplex algorithm?`\n",
    "Your linear equations will create a polygon in the solution space.\n",
    "The optimal solution will be a point (corner) in this polygon, usually.\n",
    "If it's not a corner, you either have no solutions or infinite solutions.\n",
    "Anyway, you have this polygon, and simplex 'hill climbs' this polygon.\n",
    "It starts at one edge of the polygon, finds a corner, \n",
    "and checks that corners value with the objective function.\n",
    "If saves the best corner value it has seen so far.\n",
    "It looks ahead to the next corner.\n",
    "If the next corner is better, it moves to that corner.\n",
    "If simplex looks ahead and sees a corner that is the same or worse (less than or equal to) the the corner it's on right now, simplex knows it has found the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Why does that imply it's the optimal solution?  Why couldn't it be in a local maxima?`\n",
    "Remember that this is linear programming.  Theres only lines, planes, and hyperplanes.  Try and make a local optima using just those.  Well, don't, actually, because you can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "`How does simplex hill climb in 3d and beyond?`\n",
    "It hill climbs pretty much the same, except now simplex is checking multiple neighbors and picking the best one.  So in 3d, simplex starts at some point, and checks the 3 adjacent points.  Then it goes to the best one.  Then at its new location it checks its 3 adjacent points.  Or maybe 2 considering it was just at 1 of those 3 neighbors.  Anyway, in 4d you would check 3 neighbors, in 5d you would check 4 neighbors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Simplex can't 'see' the polygon its optimizing on.  How does simplex find 'corners' without using geometry?`\n",
    "A corner, or 'vertex' is a sharp bend in the polygon.  The vertices are where at least 2 inequalities (lines/planes/hyperplanes) cross.  2 vertices are neighbors if they share all but 1 inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not really sure how it's done, and I don't really care anymore, because I just read that there's better methods than simplex now.  Maybe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some vertices can be created in more than 1 way.  These vertices are 'degenerate', which is bad.  Simplex needs to do extra computations on these, or something.\n",

    "`What is this thing:  A magic trick called duality?  What are they talking about?`\n",
    "They say 'where did the 0, 1, 1, 4' thing come from.  I'm pretty sure that's just a bunch of linear algebra row reduction stuff to get the objective function.\n",
    "So it proves the optimality of the solution.  Note that it doesn't give the solution.  We want a point that tells us what each of the x's are.  This only tells us the best we can do is 3100.  It doesn't tell us how to get to 3100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that with the chocolate example, you could get bounds that aren't as tight as possible.  It's under the duality section.\n",

    "`Why is integer linear programming exponential time?`\n",
    "Let's say you're the mayor of a town, and want to hire A police, B firefighters, and C teachers.\n",
    "Obviously you can only hire an integer amount of each of these.\n",
    "Now let's say you used a regular linear programming method and got a bunch of decimal values for each job.\n",
    "You get A=10.6, B = 5.4, C = 12.5.\n",
    "So you think to yourself: easy, I know i'll need to hire A=10-11, B=5-6, C=12-13.  I'll just check each of those combinations.\n",
    "But that's basically checking every possible combination of a 3 digit binary string.\n",
    "If you had a hundred jobs, you would have to check each combination for a 100 bit binary string.\n",
    "That's $O(2^n)$ time.\n",
    "Of course, there are plenty of heuristics you could use.\n",
    "Stuff like 'I know if I hire 11 police, there won't be enough budget for 13 teachers, so all combos of 11 police and 13 teachers are off the table.'\n",
    "But it's still exponential time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`What is going on in the duality section?`\n",
    "It's saying:\n",
    "We have these linear inequalities.  \n",
    "Some linear combination of them will be the same as our objective function.\n",
    "If we can get this linear combo of the constraints, we can figure out the tightest possible bound on our objective function, and we'll know for sure whether we actually computed the maximum or not.\n",
    "All the y's are the mysterious ratios that we need in order to make the combined left hand side of these inequalities look like our objective function.  \n",
    "Then we'll have a bound on our objective function.\n",
    "We want the smallest possible values for the y's so we can get the tightest bound possible.\n",
    "So we want to minimize the y's.\n",
    "Wow, that's a linear programming problem.\n",
    "So this new linear programming problem that minimizes something and is kind of the opposite of our primal (meaning original) problem actually solves the same thing.\n",
    "So if we solve this 'dual' problem for all the y's, and plugging those y's into our objective function thing results in the same thing as when we plugged in the x's, we know we got the right answer in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for now, I would think of duality as a way to check your answer.  If you do your answer wrong the first time, and then you do the dual problem, you'll get different solutions.  Then you'll know you either did the primal or the dual problem incorrectly.  I guess it might be possible for you to do both problems incorrectly and end up at the same answer.  But since the problems are really mathematically different, you would have to mess up in 2 different ways and somehow end up at the same answer.  What are the odds of that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also people are always calling duality 'beautiful' so maybe there's some 'deeper' meaning here.  I mean, I think it's aesthetically cool.  But usually what people mean by 'beautiful' is that it still holds many secrets or some other such thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Might also want to read that 'visualizing duality' section of the book on page 210."
