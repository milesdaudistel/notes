<details><summary>Notation</summary>
We'll start off with this example:

	E -> T | T + E
	T -> int | int * T | (E)

`grammar` the whole thing

`E, T` nonterminals

`int, *, (, )` terminals

`E -> T` the first production of E

`T -> int * T` the second production of T

`|` used to separate the productions of the nonterminals

`->` E can be converted to T

`->*` X can be converted to Y in ? steps

<details><summary>DFA to Table Driven</summary>
Consider this regex of all binary strings that end in 1:

	(1|0)*1

Whose DFA implementation is as follows:	

![endsin1](pics/endsin1.png)

We can convert this DFA into a table.  A table is easy to implement in code, as well as fast.  Here is a table equivalent to the DFA:

         | 0 | 1 |
      ---|---|---|
 _**S**_ | T | U |
 _**T**_ | T | U |
 _**U**_ | T | U |
 
 Say we have the input `0101`.  We are in state S, and the next input is 0, so we look at row S, column 0, whose entry is T.  This means we are now in state T.  
 
 The next input is 1, so we look in row T, column 1, whose entry is U.  Now we are in state U.  
 
 The next input is 0, so we look in row U, column 0, whose entry is T.  Now we are in state T.
 
 The next input is 1, so we look in row T, column 1, whose entry is U.  Now we are in state U.
 
 There is no more input, so we are done.  One thing that isn't in table that we need to somehow specify is that U is an accepting state, and S and T aren't.  Implemention is trivial and will be omitted :^)

<details><summary>Recursive Descent</summary>
Easiest type of parsing.  Takes almost any context free grammar (left recursive and something else don't work without some kind of modification).

Example Grammar

	E -> T | T + E
	T -> int | int * T | (E)
	
Example Functions

	bool Term(Token tok) { return *next++ == tok; }
	
	bool E() { 
		Token *save = next;
		
	
	bool E_1() { return T(); }
	bool E_2() { return T() && term('+') && E(); }
	
	bool T_1() { return term(INT); }
	bool T_2() { return term(INT) && term('*') && T(); }
	bool T_3() { return term('(') && E() && term(')'); }

<details><summary>Predictive Parsing and LL(k) grammars</summary>
Predictive parsing is a confusing term.  Saying that you have a 'predictive parser' is not a statement about your parsing algorithm (recursive descent, shift reduce, etc).  Saying that you have a predictive parser means that the grammar your parser reads is an LL(k) grammar.  LL(k) grammars are a special kind of context-free grammars.  By looking at the next k tokens, we can narrow down the possible productions to 1 at every step.  This means there will never be any backtracking.

Here is an example of a normal context-free grammar:

	A -> aaaa | aaab
	
Let's say we get the input `aaab`.  This grammar starts at the first production of A, matchs the first, second and third `a`, then hits `b` and has to backtrack.  Starting over at the first `a`, the parser matches the input with the second production, and we're done.

Here's an LL(k) grammar that parses the same language as above:

	A -> aaaX
	X -> a | b
	
In this grammar, k=1 because you only have to look at the next token to decide whether or not to keep parsing or error out.  For our input `aaab`, we match the first 3 `a`'s one at a time, then look at X.  `b` doesn't match X's first production, so we go to X's second production and get a match.  This is better than the first grammar because we only had to match `aaa` once.

So LL(k) grammars don't have to backtrack, unlike most context-free grammars.

Random facts:

All context-free grammars have an LL(k) equivalent.  Tools like ANTLR can transform context-free grammars into LL(k) grammars automatically.

In practice, we'll always be looking at LL(1) grammars. LL(k>1) grammars don't matter.

<details><summary>LL(k) vs regular grammars</summary>
Consider this grammar that parses nested parenthesis:

	E -> (E) | epsilon

Regular grammars can't describe nested parens.  So LL(k) grammars are more general that regular grammars.  

LL(k) grammars can be parsed in linear time just like regular grammars, unlike non-LL(k) context-free grammars.

<details><summary>First and Follow Sets</summary>

Remember how we converted DFA's into tables?  Tables are simple to implement in code, and fast to execute.  Now we want to make a parsing table for LL(1) grammars.  To make an LL(1) parsing table, we need first and follow sets.
