    "Remember from the 170 textbook that dynamic programming is a 'sledgehammer' approach to computational problem solving.  It solves a lot of problems, which is why it is so commonly asked about on coding interviews.  Dynamic programming isn't an algorithm; it's an algorithmic paradigm.  Different problems require different algorithms, but if the problems solution algorithm stores solutions to subproblems for later use, then its a dynamic programming algorithm.\n",
