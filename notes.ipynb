Most (dumb or poor) people spend all their money as soon as they get it.  So everyone would be declaring bankruptcy all the time.  So the government has to guess how much money it should be taking from you.  Since you will be making 50 an hour 3 months out of the year, the government will probably be taking a much larger chunk of your money than you initially expected.  This is when you file for a tax refund.\n",

The method for opening up the app corresponding to the icon should be asynchronous, because if it wasn't, the user couldn't move their mouse after clicking the icon.  Asynchronous calls are important even if you only have 1 core.  Think of a thread as a job, and a core as a worker.  If you only have 1 worker, you can't have them work on just 1 job at a time.  That would be bad for the user.  So our 1 worker juggles multiple jobs at the same time, and users have the illusion that many operations are happening simultaneously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An event is just 'something that has happened'; a mouse click, a keyboard input, a new email, etc.  Since these things happen all the time, we need asynchronous methods that can run concurrently in order to catch and handle all these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't just want async methods to catch events, we also want to tell them what to do with the events.  We can do this by passing the async method a callback function as a parameter.  An example is when you set onClick in an html tag.  The thing that you set onClick to is the callback function.  Maybe your callback function plays an animation, or redirects the user to another page through a link.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder 'Why do we need to pass a callback in as a parameter?  Why not just put that code directly into the asynchronous function?'  To answer that, think about this scenario:  you have a website that has a whole bunch of different clickable buttons.  Some buttons link you to other pages, some buttons open drop down menus, some display images.  All of these buttons have asynchronous functions behind them, waiting for clicks.  But when they get a click, they all do different things.  If you had to program all these buttons, it would be much easier to write the part of the program that listens for clicks once, rather than copying and pasting it again and again for every single button.  So the reason callback functions are so common is that asynchronous functions often just listen for events, so passing in the 'what to do after you get the event' logic as a parameter is easier than writing it directly into the asynchronous method.\n",

At least no rules that stick around for more than a few years), so I won't write too much about this.  The model is the data.  User data, embedded videos, ability to comment on things, etc.  It's all the functionality of the website.  The view is the user interface.  It changes itself when it sees a change in the model.  The controller handles events.  It watches the user (and other possible events) and changes the model accordingly.

You can't write pure sql, only an implementation, like MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.  It's kind of like this: SQL is like the Linux kernel, and all of its flavors are like the different distributions; Ubuntu, Debian, etc.  They each have different bells and whistles, but they all implement the same core functionality of SQL.  Everything below applies to all types of SQL.\n",

    "But won't it be slow?  Technically, yes.  It will be much slower.  But a single database transaction takes very little time from a humans perspective.  Retrieving data is fast.  Manipulating data (as in manipulating numbers) is slow.  Say your database takes 1 second to return all the data you need.  But if you optimized, it could take 0.01 seconds.  But lets say your big data program that crunches numbers takes 100 seconds to run.  Now it doesn't seem like such a big deal that your database is 100x slower than it could be.\n",
    "The point of all this is: the time it takes to retrieve data from a database is pretty much always negligable compared to whatever else you're doing.  It doesn't matter how fast it could potentially be.  What matters is that we keep the data size small, and also to keep SQL as simple as possible.  So when working with SQL, forget about runtime.  What matters is keeping things conceptually simple and clean.  I would say as long as your database queries take less than half a second to run, you're good.\n",

Then you could query for how much a certain customer bought in a day.  Or maybe there's 1 table that contains customer, time, and all the stuff they bought.  Another table contains items, and their prices.  So you could find out how much 1 person bought on a certain day by joining the tables and etc etc.  And it would also make sense as to why you would want to keep those tables separate.  Imagine if we put all the money values for each item as a column for each individual thing a customer bought.  We would have a lot of redundant cash values.  Oh look, Cindy bought apples.  Oh, Malcolm bought apples too.\n",

    "A container is like a virtual machine, but lighter weight.  While a VM requires you to have a whole copy of an operating system, a container only requires you to have a copy of the parts of an operating system that you want to change.  Let's say you are running Linux, and you want to be able to run both python2 and python3.  Those might conflict with each other, so what you can do is create a container image for both of them.  The container image will have a copy of your .bash_profile (your PATH variable) and a different set of files in /lib/python.  With virtual environments, you would have to have Linux running on your computer, and 2 more images of Linux on top of that.  That means 3 copies of the kernel, 3 copies of GNU, 3 copies of every file on your computer.  That's a lot of memory, and it tends to be slow.  With containers, you start with just 1 copy of everything, then you make 2 more copies of your path variable, modify them, and 2 more copies of your python libraries, and modify them.  In a way, it's kind of like branching in a git repository, but for your operating system.  You only need to make a copy of things you are going to modify.\n",

Also, simpler explanation: whenever you download a program and want to run it, it changes your computers environment.  It could change, update, or delete just about anything on your operating system so that it can run.  So you might potentially break an old program by installing a new one.  How do you stop this from happening?  A lot of people used virtual machines.  If you mess something up in a virtual machine, you can just uninstall it or make another vm, whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that virtual machines are big.  You have a whole other operating system on top of yours.  It would be faster / easier to make a copy of just the files you needed.  This is where containers come in.  When you make a container, you make a special folder.  Let's say you download Java 10.4.  Java 10.4 needs file X.  Then you download C++17.  C++17 needs file X too, but modified.  If you do it in a container, C++17 will make a copy of file X, modify it, and keep it.  No one outside the container can see modified X.  \n",

    "Maybe with this above example, you should emphasize that it makes sure things don't break, and is simpler than a VM first.  This is just a positive consequence of those things.\n",

There's no way to log in to wikipedia, or play web games, etc.  In order to do those things, javascript is necessary, because it allows for more complex back and forth communication between the client and server.  In pure HTML over a TCP/IP connection, a client can only ask the server to send them different static web pages.

Now lets instead say the way your website is coded won't allow you to just add servers.  So before you pay for more servers, you need to change a whole bunch of stuff in your codebase so that the website can work with more servers.  In this case, your website is not easily scalable.\n",

    "Here's another example:  let's say we have a function in whatever programming language, f(x) = y.  f takes in x, does some calculations, and spits out y.  If the runtime of f is O(n), then as x gets bigger and bigger, the time it takes for f to calculate y will scale at the same rate as x.  I'd say this is pretty good scaling.  If f's runtime is O(log(n)), that's pretty great scaling.  If f has runtime O(2^n), that's some pretty bad scaling.\n",

    "`Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling` Horizontal scaling means you add more of what you have in order to scale.  Vertical scaling means you improve what you have in order to scale.  Let's say we're the head of a delivery business, with a fleet of delivery vans, and you can guarentee any delivery in 1 day.  Now lets say that suddenly you're getting 4x as many delivery requests each day.  You still want keep your 1 day delivery promise.  You could scale your company vertically by trading in the delivery vans for delivery semi-trucks, or you could scale horizontally by buying more delivery vans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, horizontal scaling is quicker, easier, and cheaper than vertical scaling.\n",

    "`SaaS` stands for 'Software as a Service.'  In the past, you would buy software like microsoft word or a video game on a disk, put it in your computer, and run it.  The disk is a product.  You pay for it once, the software developer gets payed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, rather than paying for a piece of software that (theoretically) works forever, we now pay for software services that get updated continuously with new features.  Services like spotify, netflix.  I'll call them spotflix.  Spotflix doesn't sell you a product containing all of their songs and movies.  They sell you a service where you request a song or movie, and you get that song or movie streamed to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since spotflix runs on a server, and you have to log in to that server, they can charge you continuously per month or year, rather than charging you once at the beginning.  This has proven to be much more profitable than the old model.  Additionally, since they're streaming media and not selling it outright, it's much more difficult to make a copy of that media and distribute it freely.  But hey, this way you continuously get new songs and movies while paying a flat rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Platform` kind of like the terms library, framework, or API, but more general.  The 3 previous terms usually mean code that you call, but a platform can be something like a website template that you can extend.  I feel like Reddit is a kind of platform for forums.   \n",

    "`anaconda` is conda + virtual environments.  So anaconda will let you manage your python versions as well as your packages.  Some people call it a `distribution`.  I think they use this term because anaconda is similar to a virtual machine, but lighter weight.  Kind of like a container.  Jupyter notebooks recommend using anaconda, so you should use them.  Don't try to install anaconda through brew.  Should a package manager manage another package manager?  No.  Use the installer.\n",
