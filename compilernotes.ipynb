    "A compiler is a program that takes your code (like C or Go) and turns it into a file containing only 0's and 1's.  These 0's and 1's can then be run on a computer.  A compiler consists of 5 stages:  Lexing, Parsing, Semantic Analysis, Optimization, and Code Generation. \n",

    "<details><summary>What are interpreters?  How are they different from compilers?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter takes your code and just runs it without outputting a binary file.  It still does the same job of turning your code into 0's and 1's, however.  So running a binary file output from a compiler will be faster than running a source file through an interpreter.\n",

    "\t\tprint(i)\n",
    "\t\n",
    "To a compiler, your program currently looks like an array of characters: \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t[ w, h, i, l, e, (, t, r, u, e, ), :, p, r, i, n, t, (, i, ) ]\n",
    "\t\n",
    "As they are, the compiler has no idea what these characters mean.  The first part of the compiler is called the lexer.  It takes this stream of characters and turn it into a stream of tokens, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t[ while, (, true, ), :, print, (, i, ) ]\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Lexers use the maximum munch rule.  The maximum munch rule means that the lexer will create the biggest tokens it possibly can.  So first it sees a 'w', and thinks \"this could be an ID... I'll keep going\".  Then it sees an h, an i, an l, an e, and a (.  Then it thinks \"Ok, I know that 'while(' isn't a possible token, so the biggest token I can make is 'while'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexer knows to make 'while' a WHILE token, and not an ID='while' token through precedence rules, which are hard-coded.  So when it sees a 'while', it thinks \"this could be an ID, or it could be a WHILE token.  Since WHILE takes precedence over ID, I'll make this a WHILE\".\n",
    "</details> \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do we actually code a lexer?  In other words, how do we create a program that will clump characters into tokens?  The answer is with regular expressions, or regex.  Regex describe patterns of characters using 3 operators:  Grouping, Boolean OR, and Quantification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tGrouping:  r\"ab\" matches the string 'ab'\n",
    "\tBoolean OR:  r\"a|b\" matches the string 'a', or the string 'b'\n",

    "\t\n",
    "You may have seen other regex operators in Java or Python, like + or ?.  These operators are just shortcuts of the 3 operators above.  `a+` is equivalent to `aa*` and `a?` is equivalent to `a|`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use regex to decide whether some string matches a pattern.  If we had a big file called X.txt, and we wanted to know if it contained only numbers, we could do it with regular expressions in python like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\timport re\n",
    "\t\n",

But rather than printing things out, a real lexer would call a function that would emit a token; something like `emitToken(tokenName, tokenValue)`.  For this example, rather than calling `print(\"Match\")` we would call `emitToken(INT, 98560134760976 )`, which would emit an INT token object whose value was 98560134760976.\n",

    "Regex can match a lot of patterns, but there are certain patterns it can't match that we need to make a real programming language.  Consider C, or Java.  These languages require parenthesis and curly braces to be balanced, which means for every '(' that opens up a new scope, there needs to be a ')' to close the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now see if you can think of a regular expression that can match '()', '(())', '((()))', '(((())))', etc, all the way up to an arbitrary number of parenthesis, _without_ matching anything unbalanced, like '(()', '(()))', etc.  Your first thought might be something like `(*)*`, but that would end up matching '(()' and '(()))'.  Next you might try something like `()|(())|((()))|(((())))|....` Which is a good effort.  You could make a regex expression that could match balanced parenthesis in the hundreds, thousands, millions, or beyond, but you can never create a regex expression that can match an arbitrary number of parenthesis.  But the parser will take care of that, so our lexer doesn't have to worry about it.\n",

The vertical bar character | is used show where we are in our parse.  For instance, 'int * int | + int' means that our parser has looked at the 3 tokens 'int * int' and has put them on the item stack.  The parser has not yet looked at '+ int', and it has not yet reduced anything.  Whenever a shift move occurs, we put another token onto our stack, and move the | over by 1.  When we do a reduce move, some things to the left of the | will be changed, and we won't look at another token of input for that step."

Rather than taking tokens and combining them into non-terminals, they started at the start symbol non-terminal, and broke up the start symbol into its child terminals and non-terminals.  For example, it would start at E, and break that up into T using production 4.  Sometimes (most of the time) it would choose the wrong production.

Right now, I would recommend using a parser generator like Bison.  It's much less work.

    "\n",
    "Here's how the graph works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that our parser works in steps.  At each step, the parser decides whether to shift or reduce.  It decides by looking through the stack, bottom to top.  At each item in the stack, it makes a transition in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before explaining each part of the graph, let's first go through an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we're parsing `int * int + int`, and the parse stack is `int * | int + int`, so 'int' and '*' are on the stack.  Now the parser decides what's next:  shift the next 'int', or reduce something on the stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser looks at its graph, always starting in the start state.  Then it looks at the bottom of the stack, sees an 'int', and travels to state 4.  Then it sees a '*' and travels to state 8.  Now that the parser has gone through the entire stack, the final state is 8, and the shift/reduce decision is based on state 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state has a bunch of `items` in it.  An item looks like a production with a . somewhere on its right hand side.  An item says 'This is a potential production that we could reduce by.  This dot tells us how much of the production we have seen so far.'  \n",
    "\n",
    "So in the start state, the item S\\` -> .E says:  We haven't seen anything yet, because there's nothing to the left of the '.'.  If the next item on the stack is an E, we can transform that E into an S\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An item says to shift if there's at least 1 thing to the right of its '.'.  If there is nothing to the right of the '.', then the item says to reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the parser ended in state 10, it would decide to shift.  If the parser ended in state 11, it would decide to reduce by the production `T->(E)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But most of these states have multiple items; how do we decide for those states?  First, notice that all the items are shift items for most of these states, like State 1, State 5, and State 6.  They all tell you to shift, and unlike reducing, there's only 1 way to shift an item.\n",

    "However, there is a problem.  States 3 and 4 both have 1 shift item and 1 reduce item.  This is a `shift/reduce conflict`.  As our graph is now, the parser can't decide whether to shift or reduce.  We can alleviate this problem by using follow sets, which I don't feel like explaining properly.  Basically, we just peek at the next thing on the stack without putting it on the stack.  If the next thing in the input is a '+', we shift.  If it's not a '+', we reduce.  There are also `reduce/reduce conflicts` which are also solved with follow sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also another problem:  the runtime of this algorithm.  Our parser starts at the start state at every shift/reduce decision.  We can improve this by putting things on the stack along with the state that we finished on.  So instead of `int * | int + int`, we would have `(int 4) (* 8) | int + int`.  The things on the stack say 'we shifted an int because state 4 told us to, and \\* because state 8 told us to'.  Now at the next shift/reduce decision, our parser looks at the thing at the top of the stack, (* 8), and starts in state 8.\n",

Then, once you understand that only 1 token of lookahead is ever needed, explain why that's not entirely true, and that you USUALLY only ever need 1 token of lookahead.
